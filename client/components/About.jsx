        <p>I am full stack web developer with a strong commercial
          background as a chartered accountant. < br />
          I have a love for using technology to automate and solve
          everyday tasks and problems. < br />

          me to learn every day and where I can see that the input
          I'm giving is making an impact on users. < br />
