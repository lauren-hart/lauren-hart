        Enspiral is a full immersion style bootcamp apprenticeship, <br />
        where you learn to become a full stack web developer over 18 weeks. <br />
        The course teaches full stack web development using a range of technologies, <br />
        but there is a lot of emphasis on human skills in the workplace. <br />
        We were working closely in teams, doing daily pair programming, <br />
        researching and presenting technical topics, < br />
        learning about and putting into practice agile ways of working.
