               It was the final group project I worked on
               at EDA in a team of five. <br />< br />
               We completed a prototype and presented at Graduation. <br />< br />
               We are looking to continue with the project and hope to
               deploy very soon.

              Lunch Bunch was a project completed at EDA
              as part of PackHac 2018. <br /> <br />
              PackHac was a hackathon set up for ideas
              for web apps within the Pacific Island
              Community in Auckland
              (who are currently under represented). <br /> <br />
              Lunch Bunch is a way of getting kids excited
              about healthy school lunches and taking
              the stress away from busy parents.

              This is a personal project I have been working on. <br />
                <br />
              The idea stems from a club I have with some friends
               where we go on an annual holiday using joint funds. <br />
                <br />
               I was managing a spreadsheet to track the clubâ€™s
               standings and wanted something to work on that
               would allow me to translate my excel skills onto
               the web and help me practice React/Redux and APIs. </p>
